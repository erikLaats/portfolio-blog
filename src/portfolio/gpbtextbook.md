The Georgia Studies Course is an online interactive textbook used in 8th grade Georgia History classrooms across the state. Built on Craft CMS with a GraphQL content API, the course content includes worksheets, videos, interactives, and rich textâ€”all delivered through the React front end.

To support easy maintenance and editorial flexibility, we developed custom content matrices within Craft, allowing the non-technical site administrators to update the course materials and add new sections as necessary. We also designed a tailored search experience that enables students to locate terms and topics within the text, while teachers can favorite pages for quick access in a classroom setting. Each chapter includes a quiz, managed via Craft, with built-in score tracking for review.

In addition to developing the full-stack architecture and overseeing other developers on the project, I served as the primary UX designer, wireframing and prototyping the layout for the entire application.
