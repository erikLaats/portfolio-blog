The Georgia Studies Course is an online digital tool used in 8th grade Georgia History classrooms. It uses Craft CMS to maintain and organize the course content, which is delivered with GraphQL. The front end is built with React. We designed content matrices in Craft to allow easy updates to all kinds of course materials, including worksheets, videos, interactives, and text.

Searching allows students to locate terms used within the text, while favoriting enables teachers to easily return to specific pages in classroom settings. Each chapter features a quiz, also managed within Craft, that records student scores for review.

In addition to developing the full stack for the textbook, I also was the primary UX designer and wireframed the layout of the entire site.
