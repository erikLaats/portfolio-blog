Keenville is an educational assessment platform designed for kids ages 7-8. It contains over a dozen different games and interactives, each designed to assess an area of math or language curriculum. The games are connected via a world map, which allow the players to navigate with fun vehicles and explore the world of Keenville. Players are  able to customize their homes and their "Keens" (player characters).

Keenville uses animations created via Spine to bring the Keens and other characters to life. Animated elements and environments are rendered using Phaser, and reusable interactive components are maintained using dynamic HTML templating.

Keenville was used as a live assessment platform between 2020 and 2024. Currently it is available as a "static" version online to play for free.
