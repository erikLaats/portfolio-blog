Gasha GO is a collection of computer science games and animations designed to foster programmatic thinking and problem solving. It is built with TypeScript and Phaser 3, and uses Capacitor to create and manage native app versions of the game. All of the activities are also directly accessible as standalone experiences through GPS's game website.
