BELLA is a language and math assessment application for students ages 3-5. It is built with TypeScript, and uses Phaser 3 within a canvas to render gameplay elements and manage player interactions. It supports a variety of mechanics, including writing, audio recording, drag and drop, and 3D rotation.

To support the teachers and parents who will ultimately use the app, we designed several different ways to access and authenticate the site. A "magic link" option allows users to send a link to their inboxes containing a temporarily valid set of tokens and arguments. We also created a deep-linking system to support teachers accessing BELLA from the clients' proprietary platform.

In addition to the assessment/gameplay, the app also contains a dashboard for teachers and administrators to view results and trends within their classes. This dashboard is built with React.
