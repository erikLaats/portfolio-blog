<p>ELA Village is a classic RPG-style adventure game, where the player can complete quests, play minigames, and customize their castle. The world is filled with interesting characters for the player to meet and interact with using a custom dialogue system. Upon starting a quest, players follow a series of reading comprehension clues to determine the next step and progress the story.</p>

<p>It is a React project written in TypeScript, and the gameplay and animations are rendered by Phaser 3. It is connected to 4 unique minigames, which are embedded within the React wrapper via iframes. Player results within the minigames are communicated back to the main game in order to reward the player with ELA Village currency.</p>
<p>The game is playable in browser on both desktop and mobile, and is accessible via screen reader and keyboard.</p>
