<p>BELLA is a language and math assessment application for students ages 3-5. It is built with TypeScript, and uses Phaser 3 within a canvas to render gameplay elements and manage player interactions. It supports a variety of mechanics, including writing, audio recording, drag and drop, and 3D rotation.</p>
<p>To support the teachers and parents who will ultimately use the app, we designed several different ways to access and authenticate the site. A &quot;magic link&quot; option allows users to send a link to their inboxes containing a temporarily valid set of tokens and arguments. We also created a deep-linking system to support teachers accessing BELLA from the clients' proprietary platform.</p>

<p>In addition to the assessment/gameplay, the app also contains a dashboard for teachers and administrators to view results and trends within their classes. This dashboard is built with React.</p>
