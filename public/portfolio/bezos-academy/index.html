<p>BELLA is a web-based language and math assessment platform designed for learners ages 3–5. The core application is built with TypeScript and uses Phaser 3 within an HTML5 canvas to deliver interactive, game-like assessments. Gameplay mechanics include touch-based writing input, drag-and-drop counting, 3D object manipulation, and in-browser audio recording.</p>
<p>To support the different use cases of teachers and parents, we implemented multiple authentication methods and access paths. A &quot;magic link&quot; system generates temporary tokens and URL parameters for secure, password-free access via email. We also developed a deep-linking mechanism to enable integration with the client’s proprietary LMS, allowing teachers to launch BELLA directly from their platform with context-aware session tokens.</p>

<p>BELLA also includes an internal React-based dashboard for teachers and administrators to track student progress, analyze classroom trends, and export performance reports. The dashboard is designed with modular components, role-based access, and flexible data visualization patterns for showing results from different testing periods and classrooms.</p>
<p>Craft CMS was used to manage the assessment items, which are organized into item sets, subtests, and forms. Craft publishes the content as a large JSON file to a CDN, so the app can easily consume it and ensure students are taking the most up-to-date version of the assessment.</p>
