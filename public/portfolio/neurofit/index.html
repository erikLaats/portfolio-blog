<p>Neurofit is a native app built with Unity and C#. It was designed to support a health and wellness study by Drexel University, where participants could earn sci-fi themed rewards for completing fitness activities, such as exercise or healthy eating. It leverages the Fitbit API and subscription system to alert the app of player fitness participation in real time.</p>
<p>Players are grouped into teams and assigned monthly challenges. Winning teams could level up, earn badges, and unlock parts for their customizable spaceship.</p>
<p>The app features a minigame similar to Temple Run, where players fly their ship through an asteroid field.</p>
