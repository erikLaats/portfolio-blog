<p>Neurofit is a native mobile app developed in Unity using C#, created to support a health and wellness research study by Drexel University's WELL Center. The app encourages participants to engage in daily fitness and nutrition goals by offering sci-fi-themed rewards and progression systems tied to real-world activity.</p>
<p>Using the Fitbit API and subscription-based notifications, Neurofit receives real-time updates on participant activity such as exercise, steps, and sleep. Players are grouped into teams and assigned monthly challengesâ€”successful teams level up, earn badges, and unlock customizable components for their spaceship avatar. When certain thresholds are passed for physical activity or weight, OneSignal is used to send notifications to players who aren't curren't using the app to let them know about their achievement.</p>
<p>We also designed and built a Craft CMS implementation to allow the researchers to manage their participants and view and export data. It also made it possible for their team to manually tweak gameplay parameters to ensure the study goes smoothly.</p>
<p>The app also features a fast-paced Temple Run-style minigame, where players pilot their spaceship through an asteroid field, combining physical progress with interactive play.</p>
